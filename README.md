# <center>Text Mining to Decipher Free-Response Consumer Complaints<center>
The objective of this study is to identify clusters of vehicle problems from free response consumer complaints database and associated year trend. Database used in this study is the latest database and I wanted to compare the clusters obtained in the study done in 2012. The number of complaints has significantly increased since 2012 with 1.4 million complaints in the latest database and 0.7 million complaints in the database from 2012. There can be several reasons for the increased number of complaints such as increased car sales, associated manufacturing defects and company recalls.

Two severity levels from free-response data i.e. fatal incidents and incidents involving injury were analyzed using text mining method and singular value decompostion(SVD) was used to reduce the dimensionality of text data, followed by K-means clustering to make clusters.
