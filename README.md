## <center>Text Mining to Decipher Free-Response Consumer Complaints<center>

#### OBJECTIVE

The objective of this study is to identify clusters of vehicle related problem and associated year trends after 2012. Incidents representing two severity levels(fatal incidents and incidents involving injury) from the free response data in the NHTSA's vehicls owner's complaint database are analyzed using text mining approach.


Two severity levels from free-response data i.e. fatal incidents and incidents involving injury were analyzed using text mining method and singular value decompostion(SVD) was used to reduce the dimensionality of text data, followed by Kmeans and Hierarchical clustering to make clusters.
